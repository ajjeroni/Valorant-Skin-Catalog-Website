# Valorant Skin Catalog Website

This website is a catalog assessment project, the purpose is to demonstrate my understanding of basic data structures by using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My task was to operate the data of my choice by adding 2 or more features to my catalog website. The theme of my website is Valorant since I am an avid gamer and collector of skins.
